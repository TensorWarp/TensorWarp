### Overview

**TensorWarp** is a high-throughput concurrency framework currently under active research and development. It is designed to optimize data locality and synchronization for massively parallel systems.

The architecture focuses on minimizing serialization overhead in real-time simulation environments by establishing direct, zero-copy links between persistence layers and accelerator hardware.

### Core Objectives

* **Data Locality:** Optimization of memory mapping for unified architecture systems.
* **High-Frequency Synchronization:** Reducing latency in split-path networking topologies.
* **Deterministic Simulation:** Frameworks for frame-perfect state replication.

### Status: Active Research / Experimental Prototype

This repository currently serves as a placeholder for the `tensorwarp` namespace. The core runtime and associated modules are private.

* **Public Release:** TBD
* **Documentation:** [tensorwarp.io](https://tensorwarp.io) (Coming Soon)
